              Hello,
              <br>
              I am Samuel Whang, an associate software consultant currently
              working for Eagle Creek in North Dakota, US. I love working
              with databases, open data, and automation. In my spare time
              I write small scripts in bash, batch and python for linux
              and windows. I always look forward to building something new
              every day that helps improve the lives of others.
